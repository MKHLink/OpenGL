# OpenGL
This OpenGL project helped me gain experience in working with colors, textures, and positioning when it comes to working with 3D shapes. The design process involved creating the 3D shapes first and then using shaders and textures to bring them to life. This modular approach to creating 3D scenes is something I will adopt in my future work.

When it came to developing the program, I referred to other existing code bases and created one feature at a time. This made the development process simple and easy to debug. This was my approach in every single milestone as well as the final one.

Learning OpenGL helped me work with vectors and physics-based shapes, as well as multiple axes within a 3D environment. This knowledge helps me work with different graphics libraries and strengthens my skills.
